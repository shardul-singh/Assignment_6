# Assignment_6
Setup a back end server for the previous application. This needs to be a separate application. Create CRUD APIs (REST) for user model. Store data in JSON file. Use that as source of data. UI functionality should remain same. Everything should be in TS. Use express for REST APIs. Push the code to a separate repo on github. Generate a PR for review.
The APP will be open at GET http://localhost:4000/todo
POST http://localhost:4000/todo
PUT http://localhost:4000/todo/:id
DELETE http://localhost:4000/todo/:id
